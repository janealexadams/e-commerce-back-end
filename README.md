# e-commerce-back-end

## Description

This repository is a back end for an e-commerce site. Using a working Express.js API, it's configured to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Below is the Acceptance Criteria: 
* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
